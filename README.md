# partypeople.amymeli.final
github submission for comp class

Source Code is paperandcode.Rtex
All code prior to line 1,544 was used to generate PPIscores.final.csv. 
**IMPORTANT: Do not try to run the code from lines 1 - 1,544. The Project Vote Smart API is very slow, so number of queries will take you hours to generate the file. It will also cost me money if you try to run this code because the Project Vote Smart API is not free.** 
Because I was forced to provide my **private** Project Vote Smart API token, which is something I paid money for, I will remove this GitHub repository on December 31, 2021. Thanks in advance for your understanding.

Use the file PPIscores.final.csv to generate all data for the paper, beginning at line 1,544.
A full list of organizations by PPI score is available at OrgsByScore2.csv. I will incorporate this into my final methods paper when I have time to figure out how to make these data display in Latex.

A PDF version of the paper is amymeli.partypeople.12.16.2021.pdf

Thank you for reading!
