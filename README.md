# partypeople.amymeli.final
github submission for comp class

Source Code is paperandcode.Rtex

Use the file PPIscores.final.csv to generate all data for the paper, beginning at line 1,544

All code prior to line 1,544 was used to generate PPIscores.final.csv. 
IMPORTANT: Do not try to run the code from lines 1 - 1,544. The number of queries will take you hours to generate the file and will cost me money because the Project Vote Smart API is not free.

A PDF version of the paper is amymeli.partypeople.12.16.2021.pdf

Thank you for reading!
