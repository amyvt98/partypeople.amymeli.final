# partypeople.amymeli.final
github submission for comp class

Source Code is paperandcode.Rtex
All code prior to line 1,544 was used to generate PPIscores.final.csv. 
**IMPORTANT: Do not try to run the code from lines 1 - 1,544. The number of queries will take you hours to generate the file and will cost me money because the Project Vote Smart API is not free.** 
Because I was forced to provide my **private** Project Vote Smart API, which is something I paid money for, I will remove this GitHub repository on January 1, 2021. Thanks in advance for your understanding.

Use the file PPIscores.final.csv to generate all data for the paper, beginning at line 1,544.
A full list of organizations by PPI score is available at OrgsByScore2.csv. I will incorporate this into my final methods paper when I have time to figure out how to make these data display in Latex.

A PDF version of the paper is amymeli.partypeople.12.16.2021.pdf

Thank you for reading!
